                                    production... </p>
                                <p>The first step in this process, was to gather all of the information that was
                                    generated by the tool and begin organizing it for cleaning and exploration. As the
                                    tool was created in Microsoft Access, it was easy enough to export the tables of
                                    data as excel spreadsheets and save them into a repository. I set up a Github
                                    repository in order to track the progress of the project and allow for version
                                    control.

                                <p class="fh5co-lead">The Data set was small and manageable. The tool that I selected
                                    for the cleaning process was Microsoft Excel.
                                </p>
                                <p> At this point, I realized that documenting the data cleaning process would have been
                                    made easier utilizing Power Query however, there wasn't much that needed to be
                                    cleaned. The process began with deleting the lines that were incomplete. I then
                                    reformated the date column to be more consistant with data practices. Changing it to
                                    [Year, Month, Day] format. This was all that was needed for this data set. I then
                                    turned the data into a table and moved to the next phase of the process.

                                    As I am using Excel to complete this portion of the analysis, I created a copy of
                                    the excel file and checked it into github in order to keep track of any changes that
                                    would result from the analysis process. After reviewing the data in order to
                                    determine what portion of the story it would lend itself. I had determined that the
                                    most relevant information was the year to year data that was largly influenced by
                                    the economic ebbs and flows of the contract furniture industry. I needed to exclude
                                    the information from 2020 and 2021 as the inconsistancies skewed the more relevant
                                    information captured during the previous 4 years.

                                    Some background information needs to be noted in regards to the 2016 fiscal year.
                                    During this year, there were three sales representatives employed. Two Sales Reps
                                    left the company and their positions were never filled moving into the the next 3
                                    years. This becomes apparent when we move into 2017. Looking at the distribution of
                                    the quotes. each market segmant (Government, Healthcare, Education and Corporate)
                                    had there individual cycles. It also needs to be noted that this was when we had
                                    placed the installation calculator into production. Processes and procedures
                                    for implementing the OHMS calculator were still being developed.

                                    locally. The Operations Manager was completing the smaller jobs and intermarket
                                    quotes in the proof-of-concept excel calulator. The information generated by the

                                    During this period, the Team is starting to build its stride. As seen in the 1st
                                    quarter, business was building and the Operations manager was capable of easily
                                    keeping pace with the increased number of quotes that needed to be completed. As
                                    there was only one sales representative covering all four verticle markets, the
                                    volume of quotes had diminshed. this will be the a trend going into 2020.

                                    all four market segments as indicated by the consistant number of quotes that were
                                    being completed thruoghout the year. The business was in a good place to begin

                                    <p> In attempt to fill in the gaps, late 2019 moving into 2020, the company did hire
                                        more employees. The Operations work shifted to hourly work on an as needed
                                        basis. This
                                        created missing data in the quoting process. This continued through the
                                        following year, and moving into 2021. This is the reason for excluding this
                                        period of time from from the analysis. The question that was originally being
                                        asked was regarding the Frequency of quoting. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough
                                        information captured that could be back tested against historical data.
                                        In order to determine if the quote tool made a
                                        difference, would require surveying the operations team for a more qualitative
                                        answer to the success of it's implementation. As mentioned in the initial
                                        article,
                                        The tool was developed in order to provide the Operations Manager a better
                                        quality of life and, allow him the ability to complete his other tasks in an
                                        more timely manner.
